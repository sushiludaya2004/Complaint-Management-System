# Complaint-Management-System

Hey Everyone!!!

I have did this simple Complaint Management System project using Python.

Concepts used :
  * if elif else (Conditional Statements)
  * Functions

First the user is given three options to choose:
  1. Raise a complaint
  2. View Complaints
  3. Exit

1) Raise a complaint:
       Here the function includes getting the name of the user and the complaint the user wants to register. These data's are stored in a dictionary for easy access.
2) View Complaint:
       The complaints that where registered by the user can be viewed by the view complaint function , which includes the user name and the complaint.
3) Exit:
   Since the program runs on a while loop, if the user wants to end the program , just enter '3' to exit out of the program.

    This is just a beginner friendly program for easy understanding.
